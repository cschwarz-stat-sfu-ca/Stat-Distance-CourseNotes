<h2>What is distance sampling modelling?</h2>

The term "distance sampling" covers a range of methods 
for assessing wildlife abundance:
<ul>
<li>line transect sampling, in which the distances sampled are distances of 
detected objects (usually animals) from the line along which the observer travels;
<li>point transect sampling, in which the distances sampled are distances of detected 
objects (usually birds) from the point at which the observer stands;
<li>cue counting, in which the distances sampled are distances from a moving observer 
to each detected cue given by the objects of interest (usually whales); or
<li>trapping webs, in which the distances sampled are from the web centre to trapped 
objects (usually invertebrates or small terrestrial vertebrates).
</ul>

The course will concentrate primarily on line and point transect sampling but will deal
with the more advanced topics of Multiple Covariate Distance Sampling (MCDS) and
Mark-recapture Distance Sampling (MRDS). 

<p>The concepts of distance sampling will be explained and the assumptions of the methods 
discussed. Although the basic theory will be covered, the focus of the course will be 
on practical application of the methods.

<p>The course will start with an introduction to wildlife population assessment methods, 
and demonstration of how line and point transect methods are generalizations of sample 
count methods (strip counts and point counts respectively). The underlying theory and 
assumptions of both line and point transect sampling will be covered, and 
the relative merits of the two approaches in different circumstances discussed.

<p>More complex issues will then be covered. Special methods are required when animals 
occur in groups or "clusters". For example, size bias can occur - large clusters have 
a higher probability of detection than small clusters, so that population size is 
overestimated. Methods for adjusting for this bias will be given. Another issue is 
stratification, which is used to improve the precision of estimates when animal abundance, 
detection probability or clustering varies over time or space. Good survey design is an
 essential ingredient of a successful survey so design issues and field methods will be 
covered in detail. Some specialized applications of distance sampling such as cue counting, 
trapping webs, and indirect counts (e.g., dung or nests) will be mentioned.

<a name="Software"></a> 
<h2>Software</h2
There are many packages that do Distance sampling modelling. This workshop covers the usage
of the stand-alone <i>Distance</i>  program. An R-package is also available and likely "better"
for most usages because it works on all platforms (Mac and Windoze), 
it is more flexibile in data formats etc, 
 and you have the ability to  save scripts across analyses. Contact me
for details.

<p>DISTANCE 6.0 
      <br> This program is available at no charge from from http://www.ruwpa.st-and.ac.uk/distance/. 
       If you want to make use of the density surface modelling (DSM-not covered in this course) or mark-recapture distance 
       sampling (MRDS) analysis engines, you need to have the free statistics software R 
       installed on your computer. Consult the DISTANCE web site for details.

       <br>Mac users - The program DISTANCE only runs on Windows platforms. 
       So Mac users need to install a virtualization program (e.g. VirtualBox or BootCamp), 
       install Windows on the virtual machine, and then the Mac looks like a Windows machine. 
       (I'm an avid Mac user; ask me if you run into problems!)

<h2>Courses</h2>
I offer a three day course on Distance Sampling IModelling covering the following topics.
I can also do this or other courses onsite at your organization. Please contact me (<a href='mailto:cschwarz.stat.sfu.ca at gmail.com'>Carl Schwarz</a>) for information.

<p><a href=Slides>Slides  from the course</a> are available in <a href=Slides>this directory</a>.

<p>A typical course outline
<ol>
<li> Introduction and brief statistical review

<li>Line Transect Distance Sampling.

<li> Point Transect Distance sampling.

<li> Multiple covariate line and point distance sampling (MCDS)

<li> Dealing with multipliers such as animal signs.

<li> Planning a distance/point transect survey - some sample size guidelines.

<li> Mark-Recapture Distance Sampling (MRDS)

</ol>

Additonal course covering more advance topics in Distance Sampling  modelling
 (e.g. bayesian methods, spatial methods, multi-method, multi-scale) can
also be arranged. Please contact me for details.
